## Task 1 - Hangman Game
- This is my **First Task** for the **CodeAlpha Python-Programming Internship**.
  - Creating a Hangman game in Python is a fun and educational project!
  -  Beginners can use this as a small project to boost their programming skills and understanding logic

---

## Project Description

I created a **Hangman Game** using my **PYTHON SKILLS** 

Hangman is a word-guessing game where:
- A word is chosen randomly, and the player has to guess it letter by letter.
- The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (lives).
- The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or runs out of lives.

---
## Steps to Create the Game

- ## Import Required Libraries:
    - Use the random module to select a random word from a predefined list.

- ## Define the Word List:
    - Create a list of words for the game.

- ## Game Logic:
   - Display the word as underscores (_) for unguessed letters.
   - Allow the player to guess one letter at a time.
   - Check if the guessed letter is in the word.
   - Track incorrect guesses and reduce lives accordingly.
   - End the game when the word is guessed or lives reach zero.

- ## Enhancements:
  - Add input validation (e.g., ensure the player enters only one letter).
  - Display the guessed letters and remaining lives.

--- 
## Features:
- 5 predefined words
- 6 incorrect guesses allowed
- Text-based input/output
- Uses random, while loop, if-else, strings, and lists
- ASCII Hangman Art that changes as incorrect guesses increase.
- Status bar updates with visual feedback.
